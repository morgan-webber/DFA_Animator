# DFA_Animator
This is a small application I made for my Theory of Computation course at the University of Portland. It allows users to create DFAs (Deterministic Finite Automata) that are custom made or randomly generated and simulate them easily and visually on various input strings. The UI is (hopefully) intuitive to use and there are only a few minor bugs that I have come across. Hopefully those who are struggling understanding DFAs may be able to use this tool to walk them through or even practice on some random DFAs.
